# Cursor Rules for Kaggle Trees Project

## Project Type
This is a set of **static webpages** built with JavaScript and CSS. **No server-side components** are allowed.

## Technology Stack
- HTML5
- JavaScript (ES6+ modules)
- CSS
- WebGPU (for graphics/simulation)
- WebGL/WebAssembly (where applicable)

## Constraints
- All code must run entirely in the browser
- No Node.js server
- No backend APIs
- No database connections
- No server-side rendering
- No build tools that require server execution
- All assets must be served statically

## File Structure
- `index.html` - Main entry point
- `demos/` - Individual demo applications
- `js/` - Shared JavaScript modules
- `shaders/` - WebGPU/WebGL shaders
- Static assets only

## Development Guidelines
- Focus on client-side performance optimization
- Use modern web APIs (WebGPU, Web Workers, etc.)
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility where possible
- Keep bundle sizes minimal for fast loading
- Prefer vanilla JavaScript over heavy frameworks

## Deployment
- Can be deployed to any static hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)
- No build process required beyond file copying
- All dependencies must be CDN-hosted or bundled as static files
